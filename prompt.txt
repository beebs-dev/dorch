when a game server is being created, the Game k8s resource will exist but the info will not be populated in redis. Currently, this makes `master` return 404.
I want the master to return partial information constructed from the Game resource, with an addition "status" field that mirrors the Game's `status.phase`. Then I want the front end (browser/) to show an intermediate state for the server, with subtle animated loading indicators in the place of any data that is unavailable. Include the `Status: ${status}` with a little colored indicator in the first card for the server details, next to the server name, skill, etc.
