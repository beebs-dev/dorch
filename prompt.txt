- Create postgres table for wadinfo named `wad_map_images`. Its primary key is `id UUID PRIMARY KEY` generated at time of insertion. It has column `wad_id UUID NOT NULL` which corresponds to the UUID of the wad and `map_name TEXT NOT NULL` which corresponds to the map. It needs field `url TEXT NOT NULL` that points to the public https url for the image in s3, and a column `type TEXT` that is NULL if it's an ordinary image but "pano" (for panoramic images) but don't restrict the schema with an enum - just use TEXT to store this field.
- Implement an endpoint for the internal router /wad/{wad_id}/maps/{map}/images that lists all the corresponding entries from wad_map_images as Vec<WadImage> JSON: [{"id":"<screenshot id>","url":"https://wadimages.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/<wad_id>/MAP01/<image_id>.jpg","type":"pano"}, ...] Create a rust struct for this.
- Add the internal handler for /wad/{wad_id}/maps/{map}/images to the public / unprotected (no keycloak middleware) router
- Implement a PUT `/wad/{wad_id}/maps/{map}/images` for the internal server ONLY. This takes Vec<WadImage> in the request body, deletes any screenshots that have the given (wad_id, map_name) and then inserts the wad_map_image rows.
