modify the wadinfo dispatch subcommands to be this struction:

`wadinfo dispatch-images` becomes `wadinfo dispatch images`
`wadinfo dispatch-analysis` becomes `wadinfo dispatch analysis`

Then implement an http server for both that listens on port 80

Both servers have these endpoints:

POST /images/clear
- deletes all rows from the wad_dispatch_images tables

POST /images/prune
- scans an S3 bucket for folders to create a list of wad IDs that have images
- deletes any rows from the wad_dispatch_images table that doesn't have a corresponding folder in the bucket

Do the same for analysis dispatch. So, POST /analysis/clear deletes all rows in wad_dispatch_analysis, and so on.

Include PostgresArgs in the cli args and connect directly to postgres for this.
Include --bucket, --s3-region, and --s3-endpoint in the cli args.
Accept AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY via env vars only.
