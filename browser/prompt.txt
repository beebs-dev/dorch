let's redo the jumbotron on the home page to make it more like twitch.tv's jumbotron

Instead of only showing one stream at a time:


- I want the current (active) stream to be like it is now - playing the video - but smaller width-wise to create room
- I want to show the previous and next N (default=1) servers' thumbnails behind and off to the sides
- When the previous/next buttons are pressed, I want the active stream to transition to its thumbnail then move to become an "inactive" stream off to the side
- It should feel and function like a carousel, where the previous and next N streams are visible even if they're not active.
- The thumbnails should use the /servers/{game_id}/thumb?wad=X&map=Y endpoint to grab their thumbnails
