Help me write a prompt for copilot to create a matchmaking / level browser GUI for Doom. I'm using a Svelte 5 scaffold as a starting point. Use server side rendering as much as possible.

### WAD Browser
- This is the root page for the app.
- Stylized "DORCH" logo with CSS in the header on the left 
- Search bar in the page header (centered, reasonable max width)
- Show WADs in a list with some basic information (but not too verbose)
- Sort by: Featured, Release Date,  Most Played, Alphabetical
- When no search query, show hero thumbnails from featured WADs that lead to the wad details page

### WAD Details
- Individual pages for each WAD, at /wad/[wadId]
- Show an average rating (1 to 5 stars) with the total review count for the WAD
- Header with basic info up top, tabs below
- The tabs needs to accomodate the info, any available screenshots, and any available README/notes. See the schema for details on everything that needs to be accounted for. I want *all* of the information present in the schema to be visible to the user. Decide on which tabs are appropriate and what goes where.
- For the Maps tab, show the listing of the maps (and a screenshot for each map, when available)
- Show an average rating (1 to 5 stars) with the total review count for the map
- Individual pages for each map at /wad/[wadId]/maps/[mapName]
    - Show the map title
    - Show any available screenshots

### SCHEMA NOTES
- Refer to the internal server in wadinfo/ to see what all you can read from the database and what schema is returned.
- Note that the /wad/{wad_id}/map/{map_name} endpoint returns more detailed information about the specific map as well as the WAD meta. Use the WAD meta to provide additional context about the map itself.

Just so you get an idea of the character length of each field in the schema, here is an example response:
