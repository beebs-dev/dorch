Redo the home page Jumbotron so it behaves like Twitch's rotating carousel.

Functional Requirements:
1. The Jumbotron now displays multiple JumbotronItem objects at once:
   - One "active" item in the center. This is the only one rendered as a <video> element and is smaller than before to create horizontal padding.
   - The previous N and next N items (default N=1) should be visible as “inactive” items using their `thumbnail` field. These should sit behind and slightly offset left/right of the active item. Think of Twitch's jumbotron where the adjacent streams peek from the sides.

2. Interaction:
   - Prev/Next buttons should cause a carousel rotation.
   - On rotation, the current active item should animate:
       a) scale down to thumbnail size
       b) slide to its new left/right position
       c) stop playback when no longer active
   - The newly-selected thumbnail should:
       a) slide into the center
       b) scale up to active size
       c) replace the thumbnail with the video player and start playback

3. Layout:
   - Implement with Svelte component structure. Ideally:
       <JumbotronCarousel {items} visibleCount={N}>
           internally manage activeIndex, and derived previous/next slices.
       </JumbotronCarousel>
   - Each inactive item uses its `thumbnail` URL (already provided in JumbotronItem.thumbnail).
   - Use Svelte transitions/animations for movement & scaling (e.g., `spring`, `tweened`, or CSS transitions).
   - Loop the carousel (wrap around indices).

4. Implementation guidance:
   - Maintain clean reactive state for activeIndex and inactive items.
   - Use CSS transforms (scale, translateX) for smooth animations.
   - Keep item stacking logical: active stream top-most, inactive streams slightly behind with lower z-index.
   - Make the carousel responsive (e.g., use flexbox or grid with fixed aspect ratio containers).
   - Ensure hydration-safe Svelte code (no SSRed DOM access during initialization).
