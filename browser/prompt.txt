when the button is pressed, open a floating non-modal "Party" dialog in the bottom right corner of the page.

I want the dialog to have three tabs: "Chat", "Members", and settings (icon button)

Chat tab:
Just leave a blank area for chat history and put a text box at the bottom and a submit arrow to the right. We'll flesh it out more later. But still make it look like a chat interface.

Members tab:
The model here is an array of member items. Each member item has the schema {"id":"uuid of user",displayName:"display name of user"}
Enumerate the members according to their display names, in alphabetical order

Settings:
This tab button should be an icon button of a gear
It has a text box for modifying one field: Name
