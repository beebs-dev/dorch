You are working inside this repo. Implement a Doom WAD browser + map browser + (future) matchmaking UI using the existing Svelte 5 scaffold located in `browser/` (SvelteKit). Use server-side rendering as much as possible: load data in `+page.server.ts` / `+layout.server.ts` and avoid client-side fetching except for small progressive enhancements (e.g., debounced search input). Prefer `load` functions + SSR HTML.

High-level goals:
- Root page: WAD Browser with logo + search + sorting + list + featured hero thumbnails.
- WAD Details page: /wad/[wadId] with rating summary + tabbed content for ALL schema fields + maps list with thumbnails + per-map rating summary.
- Map Details page: /wad/[wadId]/maps/[mapName] showing map title + screenshots + full detailed schema from the endpoint.
- Matchmaking GUI: create a placeholder “Matchmaking” area (UI only for now) that can be wired later.

Networking / env:
- All requests that would go to `http://dorch-wadinfo` MUST instead go to `http://${env.WADINFO_BASE_URL}`.
- Implement a small API client module in `browser/src/lib/server/wadinfo.ts` that reads `WADINFO_BASE_URL` from `$env/dynamic/private` (server-only). Do NOT leak the base URL to the client.
- Do not use hardcoded `dorch-wadinfo` anywhere.

Endpoints (as seen in wadinfo/ internal server; confirm actual paths in repo):
- GET `${base}/wad?offset=&limit=` returns `{ items, full_count, offset, limit, truncated }`.
- GET `${base}/wad/{wad_id}` returns `{ meta, maps: [...] }` where each map includes `map`, `format`, plus stats/monsters/items/mechanics/difficulty/compatibility/metadata etc.
- GET `${base}/wad/{wad_id}/maps/{map_name}` returns the detailed map plus `wad_meta` included inside metadata.
- POST `${base}/search?query=...` returns `{ request_id, query, items: [...] }` (use for search).
Also check for screenshots + readme/notes endpoints in the internal server and use them if present. Where screenshots exist, render them. Where none exist, render sensible empty states.

Routing / pages to create (SvelteKit):
1) `browser/src/routes/+page.svelte` and `+page.server.ts`  (WAD Browser)
2) `browser/src/routes/wad/[wadId]/+page.svelte` and `+page.server.ts`  (WAD Details)
3) `browser/src/routes/wad/[wadId]/maps/[mapName]/+page.svelte` and `+page.server.ts`  (Map Details)
Optionally add `browser/src/routes/+layout.svelte` (shared header) and `+layout.server.ts` if needed.

UI requirements (WAD Browser root page):
- Root page is the app landing page.
- Header:
  - Left: stylized “DORCH” logo built with CSS (no image asset). Make it look like a strong doom-ish wordmark: blocky, slightly industrial, with a subtle glow or bevel effect (pure CSS).
  - Center: search bar with reasonable max-width (e.g. 640px), full width on small screens.
  - Right: leave space for future nav; add a simple “Matchmaking” button that links to a placeholder section or page (OK to be non-functional UI).
- Main content:
  - Sorting controls: Featured, Release Date, Most Played, Alphabetical.
  - When no search query: show a “Featured” hero grid of large thumbnails (use best available images; if no real endpoint exists yet, implement with placeholder images + TODO + architecture so it can be swapped to real screenshots later). Each hero card links to `/wad/[wadId]`.
  - Below: list of WADs (SSR). Each row should show a compact summary (NOT verbose):
    - Title if present else show short `sha1` prefix (e.g. first 8 chars) and a “(untitled)” label.
    - File type (PWAD/PK3), size (human readable), number of maps (if known), and corruption status badge if corrupt.
    - Optional chips: engines_guess, iwads_guess if present.
  - Pagination: SSR-friendly offset/limit, with “Next/Prev” links.

Search behavior:
- Use query param `?q=` on root page. For `q` present, call the search endpoint and render results; otherwise show the normal listing endpoint.
- Preserve sorting in query param `?sort=` and pagination `?offset=&limit=`.
- Use SSR for the search results page load. Optionally enhance with a small client-side debounce that updates the URL, but ensure it works fully without JS.

WAD Details page (/wad/[wadId]):
- Fetch server-side using GET `/wad/{wadId}`.
- Page header should show:
  - WAD title (fallback to id or sha1 prefix)
  - File summary (type, size, corrupt badge/message)
  - Content summary (map count, counts.lumps, counts.graphics, etc)
  - Engines/iWAD guesses if present.
  - Rating summary UI: average rating 1–5 stars + total review count.
    - If ratings/reviews do not exist in the schema yet, show UI in “unrated” state and implement types/placeholders in a way that can be wired later.
- Tabs below header:
  - You MUST make ALL information present in the schema visible somewhere on the page.
  - Decide the tabs based on the schema. A good default:
    - “Overview” (meta/file/content summaries, any descriptions/authors if present)
    - “Maps” (list of maps, each with screenshot thumbnail when available, plus its own rating summary 1–5 stars + review count)
    - “Screenshots” (gallery if WAD-level screenshots exist)
    - “Notes / README” (render README/notes if present; safe HTML/plaintext; preserve formatting; no XSS)
    - “Technical” (counts, compatibility, engines_guess/iwads_guess, sha1/sha256, S3 URL, etc)
  - If some data doesn’t exist, show empty states but keep the tab available if the schema supports it.
- Maps tab requirements:
  - Render a list/grid of maps with:
    - Map name (MAP01/E1M1/etc)
    - Map title if present (fallback to map name)
    - Screenshot thumbnail if available
    - Rating summary UI (avg stars + review count; if no data, show “unrated”)
  - Each item links to `/wad/[wadId]/maps/[mapName]`.

Map Details page (/wad/[wadId]/maps/[mapName]):
- Fetch server-side using GET `/wad/{wadId}/maps/{mapName}`.
- Use the included `wad_meta` to show WAD context (title, file type, etc).
- Show map title + map name prominently.
- Show any available screenshots (gallery).
- Show all detailed fields: stats, monsters.by_type, items.by_type, mechanics (teleports/keys/secret_exit), difficulty tiers, compatibility, metadata fields, etc.
- Keep presentation readable: tables for stats, chips/badges for booleans, collapsible sections for large lists like textures.

Types / schema handling:
- Create TypeScript types in `browser/src/lib/types/wadinfo.ts` representing the responses. Keep them faithful to the API but tolerant of nulls.
- Implement runtime validation lightly (optional): at least guard against missing fields and show friendly error pages.
- Implement `+error.svelte` or per-page error handling for fetch failures.

Styling:
- Use simple CSS (or Tailwind only if already installed in the scaffold). Avoid adding heavy UI libraries.
- Make it responsive: mobile-first layout, header wraps nicely, lists become stacked cards on small screens.
- Use accessible markup: semantic headings, button labels, aria attributes for tabs, focus outlines.

SSR/Performance:
- No client-side fetch for the main data; use `+page.server.ts`.
- Cache on the server where appropriate (short TTL) if you already have patterns in the repo. Otherwise leave TODO notes.
- Avoid fetching huge payloads unnecessarily; for WAD list use limit default 20-50. For search use limit 20.
- Implement pagination via offset/limit query params.

Matchmaking UI (placeholder):
- Add a minimal `/matchmaking` route or a section accessible from the header.
- UI components only: show “Create Lobby”, “Quick Match”, “Browse Lobbies” panels with placeholder buttons and a small table/list mock. No backend calls required.

Implementation steps:
1) Inspect the existing `browser/` scaffold and follow its conventions.
2) Add the server-only `wadinfo.ts` client using `fetch` with base URL from env.
3) Add types in `src/lib/types`.
4) Build the shared header (logo + search + nav) in `+layout.svelte` or reusable component.
5) Implement root page SSR loads with q/sort/pagination.
6) Implement WAD details page with tabs and complete schema display.
7) Implement map details page with full schema display.
8) Add placeholder matchmaking route.
9) Ensure builds/tests pass.

Be careful:
- Do NOT use `public` env vars for the base URL.
- Do NOT leak internal service hostnames into client bundles.
- Always URL-encode wadId and mapName.
- Render README/notes safely (escape by default; if you support markdown, use a safe markdown renderer already in repo; otherwise render as preformatted text).

Deliverables:
- All new/modified files with code.
- Brief notes in comments for any TODO where the backend schema lacks something (ratings, screenshots).


SCHEMA NOTES:
- Refer to the internal server in wadinfo/ to see what all you can read from the database and what schema is returned.
- Note that the /wad/{wad_id}/map/{map_name} endpoint returns more detailed information about the specific map as well as the WAD meta. Use the WAD meta to provide additional context about the map itself.

Just so you get an idea of the character length of each field in the schema, here is an example response:
